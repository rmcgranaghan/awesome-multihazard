A curated list of multi-hazard science, analysis, application, and impact

Follows the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) ([What is an awesome list?](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md))lists guidance and inspired by [Awesome Network Analysis](), [Awesome Deep Learning](https://github.com/ChristosChristofidis/awesome-deep-learning), and others.  Started in 2024, and updated irregularly since then.

## Books

  ### Natural Hazards
  
  ### Risk
  -   _[Routledge Handbook of Risk Studies](https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Handbook-of-Risk-Studies/Burgess-Alemanno-Zinn/p/book/9780367335922?srsltid=AfmBOoqwQaGMY2V811wwFObgBEYXH--VFzGMYGTlfnKF08HDT9Rc5-vq)_,  Edited By Adam Burgess, Alberto Alemanno, Jens Zinn (2016).

  ### Exposure and Vulnerability
  
  ### Disaster Risk Reduction
  -   _[Handbook of Hazards and Disaster Risk Reduction](https://www.routledge.com/Handbook-of-Hazards-and-Disaster-Risk-Reduction/Wisner-Gaillard-Kelman/p/book/9780415523257)_, Edited By Ben Wisner, J. C. Gaillard, Ilan Kelman (2012).

## Review Articles
- _[A review of quantification methodologies for multi-hazard interrelationships](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001282521930025X)_ by Alois Tilloy, Bruce D. Malamud, Hugo Winter, Amelie Joly-Laugel (2019). Review of grey- and peer-review literature to identify and compare current research available for the quantification of hazard interrelations, focussing on 14 different natural hazards. They use a literature database to identify trends for hazard interrelation and multi-hazard and from these group hazard interrelations into five types: triggering, change condition, compound, independence and mutually exclusive. Available open access in Earth-Science Reviews.
- _[A multi-hazard framework for spatial-temporal impact analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420922000486?via%3Dihub)_ by Silvia De Angeli, Bruce D. Malamud, Lauro Rossi, Faith E. Taylor, Eva Trasforini, Roberto Rudari (2022). A systematic analysis and organization if available literature on multi-hazard risk. They present a framework to analyze impacts resulting from hazard interactions based on the analysis of spatial and temporal evolution of hazards. Available open access in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction.


## Frameworks
- [Sendai Framework](https://www.undrr.org/implementing-sendai-framework/what-sendai-framework). The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 outlines seven clear targets and four priorities for action to prevent new and reduce existing disaster risks: (i) Understanding disaster risk; (ii) Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; (iii) Investing in disaster reduction for resilience and; (iv) Enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response, and to "Build Back Better" in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction. It aims to achieve the substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries over the next 15 years.

## Impact Examples and Stories
- _[Probabilistic cascading multi-hazard risk assessment methodology using graph theory, a New Zealand trial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221242092031520X)_ by Alexandre Dunant, Mark Bebbington, Tim Davies (2021). Research study that applies a graphical methodology for probabilistic cascading multi-hazard risk assessment in the Franz Josef area (New Zealand). Reveals that `single hazard' approaches will likely underestimate the risk from natural hazards and concludes that the Franz Josef township is under serious threat from natural hazards. Behind a paywall from the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction.
