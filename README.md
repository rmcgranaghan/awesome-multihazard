A curated list of multi-hazard science, analysis, application, and impact

Follows the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list guidance ([What is an awesome list?](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md)) and inspired by [Awesome Network Analysis](https://github.com/briatte/awesome-network-analysis#python), [Awesome Deep Learning](https://github.com/ChristosChristofidis/awesome-deep-learning), and others.  Started in 2024, and updated irregularly since then.

## Books

  ### Natural Hazards
  
  ### Risk
  -   _[Routledge Handbook of Risk Studies](https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Handbook-of-Risk-Studies/Burgess-Alemanno-Zinn/p/book/9780367335922?srsltid=AfmBOoqwQaGMY2V811wwFObgBEYXH--VFzGMYGTlfnKF08HDT9Rc5-vq)_,  Edited By Adam Burgess, Alberto Alemanno, Jens Zinn (2016).

  ### Exposure and Vulnerability
  
  ### Disaster Risk Reduction
  -   _[Handbook of Hazards and Disaster Risk Reduction](https://www.routledge.com/Handbook-of-Hazards-and-Disaster-Risk-Reduction/Wisner-Gaillard-Kelman/p/book/9780415523257)_, Edited By Ben Wisner, J. C. Gaillard, Ilan Kelman (2012).

## Review Articles
- _[A review of quantification methodologies for multi-hazard interrelationships](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001282521930025X)_ by Alois Tilloy, Bruce D. Malamud, Hugo Winter, Amelie Joly-Laugel (2019). Review of grey- and peer-review literature to identify and compare current research available for the quantification of hazard interrelations, focussing on 14 different natural hazards. They use a literature database to identify trends for hazard interrelation and multi-hazard and from these group hazard interrelations into five types: triggering, change condition, compound, independence and mutually exclusive. Available open access in Earth-Science Reviews.
- _[A multi-hazard framework for spatial-temporal impact analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420922000486?via%3Dihub)_ by Silvia De Angeli, Bruce D. Malamud, Lauro Rossi, Faith E. Taylor, Eva Trasforini, Roberto Rudari (2022). A systematic analysis and organization if available literature on multi-hazard risk. They present a framework to analyze impacts resulting from hazard interactions based on the analysis of spatial and temporal evolution of hazards. Available open access in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction.

- _[Generic Indicators of Ecological Resilience: Inferring the Chance of a Critical Transition](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-112414-054242)_ by  Marten Scheffer, Stephen R. Carpenter, Vasilis Dakos, and Egbert H. van Nes (2015). They describe an emerging family of methods for quantifying resilience on the basis of observations, particularly in the domain of ecology. Available open access in Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics. 


## Frameworks
- [Sendai Framework](https://www.undrr.org/implementing-sendai-framework/what-sendai-framework). The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 outlines seven clear targets and four priorities for action to prevent new and reduce existing disaster risks: (i) Understanding disaster risk; (ii) Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; (iii) Investing in disaster reduction for resilience and; (iv) Enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response, and to "Build Back Better" in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction. It aims to achieve the substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries over the next 15 years.

## Impacts to Critical Infrastructure

## Resilience
- _[Early-warning signals for critical transitions](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08227)_by Marten Scheffer, Jordi Bascompte, William A. Brock, Victor Brovkin, Stephen R. Carpenter, Vasilis Dakos, Hermann Held, Egbert H. van Nes, Max Rietkerk, and George Sugihara (2009). Complex dynamical systems, ranging from ecosystems to financial markets and the climate, can have tipping points at which a sudden shift to a contrasting dynamical regime may occur. Although predicting such critical points before they are reached is extremely difficult, work in different scientific fields is now suggesting the existence of generic early-warning signals that may indicate for a wide class of systems if a critical threshold is approaching. This article describes `critical slowing down' and its symptoms. 


## Datasets and Repositories

### Individual Hazards


### Critical Infrastructure
- [Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data](https://hifld-geoplatform.hub.arcgis.com/). Managed by the GMO, HIFLD curates and provides access to geospatial data on U.S. critical infrastructure. Users can view data and download CSV, KML, and Shapefiles for visualization and application development. These data are useful for assessing impact of natural hazards and multi-hazards on downstream societal infrastructure; quantifying exposure and vulnerability. Available open source from _Nature_.

## Impact Examples and Stories
- _[Probabilistic cascading multi-hazard risk assessment methodology using graph theory, a New Zealand trial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221242092031520X)_ by Alexandre Dunant, Mark Bebbington, Tim Davies (2021). Research study that applies a graphical methodology for probabilistic cascading multi-hazard risk assessment in the Franz Josef area (New Zealand). Reveals that `single hazard' approaches will likely underestimate the risk from natural hazards and concludes that the Franz Josef township is under serious threat from natural hazards. Behind a paywall from the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction.
