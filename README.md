A curated list of multi-hazard science, analysis, application, and impact

Follows the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) ([What is an awesome list?](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md))lists guidance and inspired by [Awesome Network Analysis](), [Awesome Deep Learning](https://github.com/ChristosChristofidis/awesome-deep-learning), and others.  Started in 2024, and updated irregularly since then.

  ### Exposure and Vulnerability
  
  ### Disaster Risk Reduction
  -   _[Handbook of Hazards and Disaster Risk Reduction](https://www.routledge.com/Handbook-of-Hazards-and-Disaster-Risk-Reduction/Wisner-Gaillard-Kelman/p/book/9780415523257)_, Edited By Ben Wisner, J. C. Gaillard, Ilan Kelman (2012).

## Review Articles
- _[A review of quantification methodologies for multi-hazard interrelationships](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001282521930025X) by Alois Tilloy, Bruce D. Malamud, Hugo Winter, Amelie Joly-Laugel (2019). Review of grey- and peer-review literature to identify and compare current research available for the quantification of hazard interrelations, focussing on 14 different natural hazards. They use a literature database to identify trends for hazard interrelation and multi-hazard and from these group hazard interrelations into five types: triggering, change condition, compound, independence and mutually exclusive. Available open access.
- _[A multi-hazard framework for spatial-temporal impact analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420922000486?via%3Dihub) by Silvia De Angeli, Bruce D. Malamud, Lauro Rossi, Faith E. Taylor, Eva Trasforini, Roberto Rudari (2022). A systematic analysis and organization if available literature on multi-hazard risk. They present a framework to analyze impacts resulting from hazard interactions based on the analysis of spatial and temporal evolution of hazards. Available open access.
