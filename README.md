## Books

  ### Natural Hazards
  
  ### Risk
  _note: risk is the combination of the probability of occurrence of a natural phenomenon and the magnitude of the consequences (likelihood multiplied by consequence)_

  -   _[Routledge Handbook of Risk Studies](https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Handbook-of-Risk-Studies/Burgess-Alemanno-Zinn/p/book/9780367335922?srsltid=AfmBOoqwQaGMY2V811wwFObgBEYXH--VFzGMYGTlfnKF08HDT9Rc5-vq)_,  Edited By Adam Burgess, Alberto Alemanno, Jens Zinn (2016).
  -   _[Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/risk-society/book203184)_ by Ulrich Beck (1986). This is a classic of sociological literature. It provides a panoramic view of Western societies and describes a shift from an industrial society to a new era characterized by technological hazards, the 'risk society.'  It emphasizes the social construction of environmental health risks and the increasing uncertainties and competing knowledge claims related to managing technological environmental hazards.

  ### Exposure and Vulnerability
  
  ### Disaster Risk Reduction
  -   _[Handbook of Hazards and Disaster Risk Reduction](https://www.routledge.com/Handbook-of-Hazards-and-Disaster-Risk-Reduction/Wisner-Gaillard-Kelman/p/book/9780415523257)_, Edited By Ben Wisner, J. C. Gaillard, Ilan Kelman (2012).

## Review Articles
- _[A review of quantification methodologies for multi-hazard interrelationships](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001282521930025X)_ by Alois Tilloy, Bruce D. Malamud, Hugo Winter, Amelie Joly-Laugel (2019). Review of grey- and peer-review literature to identify and compare current research available for the quantification of hazard interrelations, focussing on 14 different natural hazards. They use a literature database to identify trends for hazard interrelation and multi-hazard and from these group hazard interrelations into five types: triggering, change condition, compound, independence and mutually exclusive. Available open access in Earth-Science Reviews.
- _[A multi-hazard framework for spatial-temporal impact analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420922000486?via%3Dihub)_ by Silvia De Angeli, Bruce D. Malamud, Lauro Rossi, Faith E. Taylor, Eva Trasforini, Roberto Rudari (2022). A systematic analysis and organization if available literature on multi-hazard risk. They present a framework to analyze impacts resulting from hazard interactions based on the analysis of spatial and temporal evolution of hazards. Available open access in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction.
- _[Generic Indicators of Ecological Resilience: Inferring the Chance of a Critical Transition](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-112414-054242)_ by  Marten Scheffer, Stephen R. Carpenter, Vasilis Dakos, and Egbert H. van Nes (2015). They describe an emerging family of methods for quantifying resilience on the basis of observations, particularly in the domain of ecology. Available open access in Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics.
- _[Globally networked risks and how to respond](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12047)_ by Dirk Helbing (2013). Today’s strongly connected, global networks have produced highly interdependent systems that we do not understand and cannot control well. These systems are vulnerable to failure at all scales, posing serious threats to society, even when external shocks are absent. As the complexity and interaction strengths in our networked world increase, man-made systems can become unstable, creating uncontrollable situations even when decision-makers are well-skilled, have all data and technology at their disposal, and do their best. To make these systems manageable, a fundamental redesign is needed. A ‘Global Systems Science’ might create the required knowledge and paradigm shift in thinking. Available open access from _Nature_.

## Reports
- [United Nations Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction (GAR)](https://www.undrr.org/gar) The UN Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction (GAR) is the flagship report of the United Nations on worldwide efforts to reduce disaster risk. The GAR is published by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), and is the product of the contributions of nations, public and private disaster risk-related science and research, amongst others. Available freely.
- [Report of the open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction](https://www.undrr.org/publication/report-open-ended-intergovernmental-expert-working-group-indicators-and-terminology). Adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2017, this report presents recommended indicators to monitor the global targets of the Sendai Framework, the follow-up to and operationalization of the indicators and recommended terminology relating to disaster risk reduction. It is strongly suggested that other projects adopt this terminology and consider it a controlled vocabulary. Available freely in several languages.
- Global Risks Report ([2024 report](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/)). A publication of the World Economic Forum and developed in collaboration with Marsh McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group, the Global Risks Report explores some of the most severe risks we may face over the next decade, against a backdrop of rapid technological change, economic uncertainty, a warming planet and conflict. It is underpinned by the Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS). “Global risk” is defined as the possibility of the occurrence of an event or condition which, if it occurs, would negatively impact a significant proportion of global GDP, population or natural resources. Available freely and published annually.
- [Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/managing-the-risks-of-extreme-events-and-disasters-to-advance-climate-change-adaptation/). Published in 2012 by a long list of international authors, the report assessed the scientific literature on issues that range from the relationship between climate change and extreme weather and climate events (‘climate extremes’) to the implications of these events for society and sustainable development. The assessment concerns the interaction of climatic, environmental, and human factors that can lead to impacts and disasters, options for managing the risks posed by impacts and disasters, and the important role that non-climatic factors play in determining impacts. Available freely. 



## Frameworks
- [Sendai Framework](https://www.undrr.org/implementing-sendai-framework/what-sendai-framework). The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 outlines seven clear targets and four priorities for action to prevent new and reduce existing disaster risks: (i) Understanding disaster risk; (ii) Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; (iii) Investing in disaster reduction for resilience and; (iv) Enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response, and to "Build Back Better" in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction. It aims to achieve the substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries over the next 15 years.
- [Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA)](https://www.preventionweb.net/sendai-framework/Hyogo-Framework-for-Action). Was the global blueprint for disaster risk reduction efforts between 2005 and 2015. The HFA was adopted in 2005 at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, held in Kobe, Hyogo, Japan. Its goal was to substantially reduce disaster losses by 2015 - in lives, and in the social, economic, and environmental assets of communities and countries. At the end of the HFA implementation, Member States recognized that efforts had not led to reduced physical losses and economic impacts. They concluded that the focus of national and international attention must shift from protecting social and economic development against external shocks, to transforming growth and development to manage risks, in a holistic manner. Read more in the [Synthesis report on consultations on the post-2015 framework on disaster risk reduction (HFA2)](https://www.preventionweb.net/publications/view/32535). This served as the foundation for the creation of the Sendai Framework, which succeeded the HFA. 
- [Peril classification and hazard glossary](https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/peril-classification-and-hazard-glossary-irdr-data-publication-no-1) This glossary summarises the agreement on peril classifications and hazard definitions by the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (IRDR) programme's Disaster Loss (DATA) Project Working Group. A new and revised framework implementable by loss databases with either a high level of hazard aggregation that do not distinguish specific perils, as well as databases that use perils (hurricane, tsunami, earthquake) rather than the more general categories. In this way, the classification serves the needs of multiple types of loss databases often managed for very different purposes. This harmonised peril classification system and definitions serves the international disaster risk reduction community and contributes to the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) in regard to improving information on key hazards and their impacts.


## Impacts to Critical Infrastructure
- _[The fragility of interdependency](https://www.nature.com/articles/464984a)_ by Alessandro Vespignani (2010). Highlights and provides a perspective on the significance of _[Catastrophic cascade of failures in interdependent networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08932)_ by Buldyrev et al. (2010), which is a study of failures in interconnected networks. The article highlights the vulnerability of tightly coupled infrastructures and shows the need to consider mutually dependent network properties in designing resilient systems. Available open access from _Nature_.
- [The theory of graceful extensibility: basic rules that govern adaptive systems](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10669-018-9708-3) by David Woods (2018). The paper introduces the theory of graceful extensibility which expresses fundamental characteristics of the adaptive universe that constrain the search for sustained adaptability. The theory explains the contrast between successful and unsuccessful cases of sustained adaptability for systems that serve human purposes. Sustained adaptability refers to the ability to continue to adapt to changing environments, stakeholders, demands, contexts, and constraints (in effect, to adapt how the system in question adapts). The key new concept at the heart of the theory is graceful extensibility. Graceful extensibility is the opposite of brittleness, where brittleness is a sudden collapse or failure when events push the system up to and beyond its boundaries for handling changing disturbances and variations. As the opposite of brittleness, graceful extensibility is the ability of a system to extend its capacity to adapt when surprise events challenge its boundaries.

## Resilience
_note: resilience is the property of a system to accommodate changes and reorganize itself while maintaining the crucial attributes that give the system its unique characteristics [(Scheffer et al. 2001)](https://doi.org/10.1038/35098000)_

- _[Early-warning signals for critical transitions](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08227)_ cv v. by Marten Scheffer, Jordi Bascompte, William A. Brock, Victor Brovkin, Stephen R. Carpenter, Vasilis Dakos, Hermann Held, Egbert H. van Nes, Max Rietkerk, and George Sugihara (2009). Complex dynamical systems, ranging from ecosystems to financial markets and the climate, can have tipping points at which a sudden shift to a contrasting dynamical regime may occur. Although predicting such critical points before they are reached is extremely difficult, work in different scientific fields is now suggesting the existence of generic early-warning signals that may indicate for a wide class of systems if a critical threshold is approaching. This article describes `critical slowing down' and its symptoms.
